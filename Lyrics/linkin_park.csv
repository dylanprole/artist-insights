In the End,"it starts with one one thing i dont know why
it doesnt even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to explain in due time all i know
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away its so unreal its so unreal
didnt look out below
watch the time go right out the window
tryin to hold on didnt even know
i wasted it all just to watch you go

i kept everything inside
and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard


i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesnt even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesnt even matter


one thing i dont know why
it doesnt even matter how hard you try
keep that in mind i designed this rhyme
to remind myself how i tried so hard
in spite of the way you were mockin me
actin like i was part of your property
rememberin all the times you fought with me
im surprised it got so far
things arent the way they were before
you wouldnt even recognize me anymore
not that you knew me back then
but it all comes back to me in the end
you kept everything inside
and even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will eventually be
a memory of a time when i tried so hard


i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesnt even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesnt even matter

ive put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
theres only one thing you should know
ive put my trust in you
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
theres only one thing you should know


i tried so hard and got so far
but in the end it doesnt even matter
i had to fall to lose it all
but in the end it doesnt even matter"
One More Light,"shouldve stayed were there signs i ignored
can i help you not to hurt anymore
we saw brilliance when the world was asleep
there are things that we can have but cant keep


if they say
who cares if one more light goes out
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers flickers
who cares when someones time runs out
if a moment is all we are
or quicker quicker
who cares if one more light goes out
well i do

the reminders pull the floor from your feet
in the kitchen one more chair than you need oh
and youre angry and you should be its not fair
just cause you cant see it doesnt mean it isnt there


if they say
who cares if one more light goes out
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers flickers
who cares when someones time runs out
if a moment is all we are
or quicker quicker
who cares if one more light goes out
well i do


i do


who cares if one more light goes out
in the sky of a million stars
it flickers flickers
who cares when someones time runs out
if a moment is all we are
or quicker quicker
who cares if one more light goes out
well i do
well i do"
Heavy,"i dont like my mind right now
stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
wish that i could slow things down
i wanna let go but theres comfort in the panic
and i drive myself crazy
thinking everythings about me
yeah i drive myself crazy
cause i cant escape the gravity


im holding on
why is everything so heavy
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around whats bringing me down
if i just let go id be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy

you say that im paranoid
but im pretty sure the world is out to get me
its not like i make the choice
to let my mind stay so fucking messy
i know im not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning round me just the same
i know im not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning round me just the same


im holding on
why is everything so heavy
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around whats bringing me down
if i just let go id be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy


i know im not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning round me just the same
i know im not the center of the universe
but you keep spinning round me just the same
and i drive myself crazy
thinking everythings about me
holding on
why is everything so heavy
holding on
so much more than i can carry
i keep dragging around whats bringing me down
if i just let go id be set free
holding on
why is everything so heavy
why is everything so heavy
why is everything so heavy"
Numb,"im tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
i dont know what youre expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes


caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow

ive become so numb i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you


cant you see that youre smothering me
holding too tightly afraid to lose control
cause everything that you thought i would be
has fallen apart right in front of you


caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
every step that i take is another mistake to you
caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
and every second i waste is more than i can take


ive become so numb i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you


and i know i may end up failing too
but i know you were just like me
with someone disappointed in you
ive become so numb i cant feel you there
become so tired so much more aware
im becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you


ive become so numb i cant feel you there
im tired of being what you want me to be
ive become so numb i cant feel you there
im tired of being what you want me to be"
Crawling,"crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real


theres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming confusing
this lack of selfcontrol i fear is neverending
controlling i cant seem

to find myself again my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
im convinced that theres just too much pressure to take
ive felt this way before so insecure


crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real


discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting distracing reacting reacting
against my will i stand beside my own reflection my own reflection
its haunting its haunting how i cant seem


to find myself again my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence
im convinced that theres just too much pressure to take
ive felt this way before so insecure


crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing confusing what is real
theres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming confusing what is real
this lack of selfcontrol i fear is neverending
controlling confusing what is real"
