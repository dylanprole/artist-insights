Let Down,"ive been so good to you
whatever you need not there from me
expecting you to be a remedy
doing what you please
still making me sick at the thought of you and me
i stay with you then leave you for a week
dont answer calls or youre hung up on me im by the phone
and i wish i could breathe
im so good for you but youre so bad for me yeah

and its hard to believe that its me that youre missing
now youre trying to speak and i dont want to listen


cause youre a let down let down
cause youre a let down let down
give me one reason to make it right yeah
anything at all for another try oh oh
cause youre a let down let down


almost feel bad for you
you got my sympathy im sober now
and i can finally see with clarity
and yeah i can agree you can take the heat
im sorry that im weak
i hate myself for putting up with all your pointless fights
you were out to cheat i blocked the phone
i bet we can agree
ive been good for you but youre so bad for me


cause youre a let down let down
cause youre a let down let down
give me one reason to make it right yeah
anything at all for another try oh oh
cause youre a let down let down
cause youre a let down let down so were done


and its hard to believe that its me that youre missing
now youre trying to speak and i dont want to listen


cause youre a let down let down
cause youre a let down let down
give me one reason to make it right yeah
anything at all for another try oh oh
cause youre a let down let down"
Fall,"i wanna fall and never once look back
i wanna know i make you feel like that
i wanna make this the start of something
so can you say that you want it all


when youre out there you just wanna have fun
got me paranoid caught up in the feels
i dont even know if this shit is real
when youre out there you just wanna have fun
and i dont wanna think that its you on the run

tell me what you think about me
weve been up all night for two weeks
ive been staring into these sheets
wondering if i got what you need


i wanna fall and never once look back
i wanna know i make you feel like that
i wanna make this the start of something
i wanna feel like its all or nothing now
so can we fall and never once look back
cause baby im not looking for a ten night stand
i wanna make this the start of something
so can you say that you want it all


got me so drunk on the thought of your touch
but playing with you baby just aint enough
i came for your body but i stay for the vibe
and i dont wanna think that im just a crush


tell me what you think about me
weve been up all night for two weeks
ive been staring into these sheets
wondering if i got what you need
i wanna fall and never once look back
i wanna know i make you feel like that
i wanna make this the start of something
i wanna feel like its all or nothing now
so can we fall and never once look back
cause baby im not looking for a ten night stand
i wanna make this the start of something
so can you say that you want it all


i can feel her body asking me to give her everything
cause i know she knows weve got the finest chemistry
she got me sweatin dont know what the hell is wrong with me
cause i know she knows that we cant let it go to waste
cause i dont wanna leave it alone with a ten night stand
when youre out there you just wanna have fun
let me try to make you the one i could be that man lets go


i wanna fall and never once look back
i wanna know i make you feel like that
i wanna make this the start of something
i wanna feel like its all or nothing now
so can we fall and never once look back
cause baby im not looking for a ten night stand
i wanna make this the start of something
so can you say that you want it all"
Erase the Pain,"spinning around my mental now
oh my heads been filled with doubt
what i kept inside will eat me alive
or will it keep me safe and sound


cause im half alive
numb inside
dying to feel
im dying to feel

i cant feel anything
so lost and i cant be saved
your voice but a memory
fade to black and erase the pain
erase the pain
fade to black and erase the pain


losing a piece of what i found
losing myself in all this crowd
if i told you id die
would you keep me alive
oh would you save me from myself


half alive
numb inside
dying to feel
im dying to feel


i cant feel anything
so lost and i cant be saved
your voice but a memory
fade to black and erase the pain
erase the pain
fade to black and erase the pain
i pretend i pretend
i pretend til i bend and bend
til im broken
are you broken
i forget i forget
i forget til it crept and crept
am i hopeless
are you hopeless


i cant feel anything
so lost and i cant be saved
your voice but a memory
fade to black and erase the pain
i cant feel anything
fade to black and erase the pain
i cant feel anything
fade to black and erase the pain"
Cold Heart (Warm Blood),"didnt you tell me you would still care
didnt you tell me never be scared
didnt you tell me you would be home tonight
i wanna hate you but its too much
i wanna make you see what youve done
i wanna hear you sayin youll make this right


is it cold in your heart
are the strings getting twisted
when im old
are the memories of you or addiction

is there love strong enough strong enough
is there love strong enough strong enough


whats in a promise you couldnt keep
its always something talk is so cheap
maybe id hear you if you were home tonight
i wanna hate you tear you apart
stitch you together but i know its too hard
and im afraid to so i just let it lie


is there love strong enough strong enough
is there love strong enough strong enough


you run
try to escape your every chance just to turn it around
youre done
its getting late the partys dead and theyre closing you out
so drink em up or hear me out


is there love strong enough strong enough
is there love strong enough strong enough
idnt you tell me you would still care
is there love strong enough strong enough
didnt you tell me never be scared
is there love strong enough strong enough
didnt you tell me you would be home tonight


is it cold in your heart
are the strings getting twisted strong enough strong enough
when im old
are the memories of you or addiction strong enough strong enough"
Memories,"i remember when you looked at me
when you saw me for who i was
when you never knew me for who i wasnt
now we pass by and we say nothing
and i remember when life was young
singing things like the same old songs yeah
i remember when you told me
i was going too blind to see


now its over and its twisted
were there some things
we could have fixed if we just tried
but ill try

to take these dreams
away from me
fade this scene
into the deep
erase my mind
cause i cant sleep
ill be fine
without chasing
memories


i remember when you showed your teeth
no one else could break me down like you
you just didnt want to hear excuses
i just didnt want to hear you through it
and now i know the brokenness we
couldve probably fixed if id just tried
stead ill try


to take these dreams
away from me
fade this scene
into the deep
erase my mind
cause i cant sleep
ill be fine
without chasing
memories
im so lost
youre so gone


i remember never looking back
leaving was the same as solving problems
guess i really got what i had coming
but dont cry cause theres still time


to take these dreams
away from me
fade this scene
into the deep
erase my mind
cause i cant sleep
ill be fine
without chasing
memories
memories


im so lost
youre gone"
