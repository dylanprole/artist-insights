Little Talks,"hey
hey
hey


i dont like walking around this old and empty house
so hold my hand ill walk with you my dear
the stairs creak as you sleep its keeping me awake
its the house telling you to close your eyes
and some days i cant even dress myself
its killing me to see you this way
cause though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore

hey
hey
hey


theres an old voice in my head thats holding me back
well tell her that i miss our little talks
soon it will be over and buried with our past
we used to play outside when we were young and full of life and full of love
some days i dont know if i am wrong or right
your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
cause though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore


hey dont listen to a word i say
hey the screams all sound the same
hey though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore


hey
hey
youre gone gone gone away i watched you disappear
all thats left is a ghost of you
now were torn torn torn apart theres nothing we can do
just let me go well meet again soon
now wait wait wait for me please hang around
ill see you when i fall asleep


hey dont listen to a word i say
hey the screams all sound the same
hey though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore


dont listen to a word i say
hey the screams all sound the same
hey though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore


though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore
though the truth may vary this
ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore"
Dirty Paws,"jumping up and down the floor
my head is an animal
and once there was an animal
it had a son that mowed the lawn
the son was an okay guy
they had a pet dragonfly
the dragonfly it ran away
but it came back with a story to say



her dirty paws and furry coat
she ran down the forest slopes
the forest of talking trees
they used to sing about the birds and the bees
the bees had declared a war
the sky wasnt big enough for them all
the birds they got help from below
from dirty paws and the creatures of snow


lalala
lalalala
lalala
lalalala




so for a while things were cold
they were scared down in their holes
the forest that once was green
was colored black by those killing machines
but she and her furry friends
took down the queen bee and her men
and thats how the story goes
the story of the beast with those four dirty paws
lalala
lalalala
lalala
lalalala
lalala
lalalala
lalala
lalalala"
Love Love Love,"well maybe im a crook
for stealing your heart away
yeah maybe im a crook
for not caring for it
yeah maybe im a
bad bad bad
bad person
well baby i know


and these fingertips
will never run through your skin
and those bright blue eyes
can only meet mine
across a room
filled with people that are
less important than you

all cause you love love love
when you know i cant love
you love love love
when you know i cant love
you love love love
when you know i cant love you


so i think its best
we both forget
before we dwell on it


the way you held me so tight
all through the night till
it was near
morning


cause you love love love
when you know i cant love
you love love love
when you know i cant love

you love love love
when you know i cant love
you
all cause you love love love
when you know i cant love
you love love love
when you know i cant love

you love love love
when you know i cant love
you"
King And Lionheart,"taking over this town they should worry
but these problems aside i think i taught you well
that we wont run and we wont run and we wont run


and in the winter night sky ships are sailing
looking down on these bright blue city lights
and they wont wait and they wont wait and they wont wait
were here to stay were here to stay were here to stay

howling ghosts they reappear
in mountains that are stacked with fear
but youre a king and im a lionheart
a lionheart


his crown lit up the way as we moved slowly
past the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind
though far away though far away though far away
were still the same were still the same were still the same


howling ghosts they reappear
in mountains that are stacked with fear
but youre a king and im a lionheart


and in the sea thats painted black
creatures lurk below the deck
but youre a king and im a lionheart
and as the world comes to an end
ill be here to hold your hand
cause youre my king and im your lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
howling ghosts they reappear
in mountains that are stacked with fear
but youre a king and im a lionheart


and in the sea thats painted black
creatures lurk below the deck
but youre a king and im a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart
a lionheart"
Crystals,"lost in skies of powdered gold
caught in clouds of silver ropes
showered by the empty hopes
as i tumble down falling fast to the ground


i know ill wither so peel away the bark
cause nothing grows when it is dark
in spite of all my fears i can see it all so clear
i see it all so clear

whoaohohoh cover your crystal eyes
and feel the tones that tremble down your spine
whoaohohoh cover your crystal eyes
and let your colours bleed and blend with mine


making waves in pitch black sand
feel the salt dance on my hands
raw and charcoal coloured thighs
feel so cold and my skin feels so paperthin


i know ill wither so peel away the bark
cause nothing grows when it is dark
in spite of all my fears i can see it all so clear
i see it all so clear


whoaohohoh cover your crystal eyes
and feel the tones that tremble down your spine
whoaohohoh cover your crystal eyes
and let your colours bleed and blend with mine


but im okay in seethrough skin
i forgive what is within
because im in this house im in this home
all my time
whoaohohoh cover your crystal eyes
and feel the tones that tremble down your spine
whoaohohoh cover your crystal eyes
and let your colours bleed and blend with mine"
