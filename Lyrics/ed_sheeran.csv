Shape of You,"the club isnt the best place to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
me and my friends at the table doing shots
drinking fast and then we talk slow
and you come over and start up a conversation with just me
and trust me ill give it a chance now
take my hand stop put van the man on the jukebox
and then we start to dance and now im singing like


girl you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now follow my lead
i may be crazy dont mind me
say boy lets not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now follow my lead
come come on now follow my lead

im in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
im in love with your body
and last night you were in my room
and now my bed sheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
im in love with your body


oh i oh i oh i oh i
im in love with your body
oh i oh i oh i oh i
im in love with your body
oh i oh i oh i oh i
im in love with your body
every day discovering something brand new
im in love with the shape of you


one week in we let the story begin
were going out on our first date
you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
fill up your bag and i fill up a plate
we talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
and how your family is doing okay
leave and get in a taxi then kiss in the backseat
tell the driver make the radio play and im singing like
girl you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now follow my lead
i may be crazy dont mind me
say boy lets not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now follow my lead
come come on now follow my lead


im in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
im in love with your body
and last night you were in my room
and now my bed sheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
im in love with your body


oh i oh i oh i oh i
im in love with your body
oh i oh i oh i oh i
im in love with your body
oh i oh i oh i oh i
im in love with your body
every day discovering something brand new
im in love with the shape of you

come on be my baby come on
come on be my baby come on
come on be my baby come on
come on be my baby come on
come on be my baby come on

we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
im in love with your body
last night you were in my room
and now my bed sheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
im in love with your body

Perfect,"i found a love for me
oh darling just dive right in and follow my lead
well i found a girl beautiful and sweet
oh i never knew you were the someone waiting for me


cause we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowing what it was
i will not give you up this time
but darling just kiss me slow your heart is all i own
and in your eyes youre holding mine

baby im dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song
when you said you looked a mess i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it darling you look perfect tonight


well i found a woman stronger than anyone i know
she shares my dreams i hope that someday ill share her home
i found a love to carry more than just my secrets
to carry love to carry children of our own


we are still kids but were so in love
fighting against all odds
i know well be alright this time
darling just hold my hand
be my girl ill be your man
i see my future in your eyes


baby im dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song
when i saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
i dont deserve this darling you look perfect tonight


baby im dancing in the dark with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song
i have faith in what i see
now i know i have met an angel in person
and she looks perfect


i dont deserve this
you look perfect tonight"
Castle on the Hill,"when i was six years old i broke my leg
i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then take me back to when i


found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and ive not seen the roaring fields in so long i know ive grown
but i cant wait to go home

im on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel and its real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night i dont reckon that i did it right
but i was younger then take me back to when


we found weekend jobs when we got paid
wed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how weve grown
but i cant wait to go home


im on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel and its real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
ones brother overdosed
ones already on his second wife
ones just barely getting by
but these people raised me
and i cant wait to go home


and im on my way i still remember
these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel its real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill"
Happier,"walking down 29th and park
i saw you in anothers arm
only a month weve been apart
you look happier
saw you walk inside a bar
he said something to make you laugh
i saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
yeah you look happier you do


aint nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but aint nobody love you like i do
promise that i will not take it personal baby
if youre moving on with someone new

cause baby you look happier you do
my friends told me one day ill feel it too
and until then ill smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you


sat in the corner of the room
everythings reminding me of you
nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
youre happier arent you


oh aint nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but aint nobody need you like i do
i know that theres others that deserve you
but my darling i am still in love with you


but i guess you look happier you do
my friends told me one day ill feel it too
i could try to smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you


â€˜cause baby you look happier you do
i knew one day youd fall for someone new
but if he breaks your heart like lovers do
just know that ill be waiting here for you"
Thinking Out Loud,"when your legs dont work like they used to before
and i cant sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks


and darling i will be loving you till were seventy
and baby my heart could still fall as hard at twentythree
and im thinking bout how
people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well me i fall in love with you every single day
and i just wanna tell you i am

so honey now take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart im thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are


when my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds dont remember my name
when my hands dont play the strings the same way
i know you will still love me the same


cause honey your soul could never grow old its evergreen
and baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
im thinking bout how
people fall in love in mysterious ways
and maybe its all part of a plan
well ill just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that youll understand


that baby now take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart im thinking out loud
and maybe we found love right where we are


so baby now take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
oh darling place your head on my beating heart im thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are
oh baby we found love right where we are
and we found love right where we are"
