Hello,"hello its me
i was wondering if after all these years youd like to meet
to go over everything
they say that times supposed to heal ya but i aint done much healing
hello can you hear me
im in california dreaming about who we used to be
when we were younger and free
ive forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


theres such a difference between us
and a million miles

hello from the other side
i mustve called a thousand times
to tell you im sorry for everything that ive done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside
at least i can say that ive tried
to tell you im sorry for breaking your heart
but it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore


hello how are you
its so typical of me to talk about myself im sorry
i hope that youre well
did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened


its no secret that the both of us
are running out of time

so hello from the other side other side
i mustve called a thousand times thousand times
to tell you im sorry for everything that ive done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside outside
at least i can say that ive tried ive tried
to tell you im sorry for breaking your heart
but it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore
highs highs highs highs lows lows lows lows
ooh anymore
highs highs highs highs lows lows lows lows
ooh anymore
highs highs highs highs lows lows lows lows
ooh anymore
highs highs highs highs lows lows lows lows
anymore

hello from the other side other side
i mustve called a thousand times thousand times
to tell you im sorry for everything that ive done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside outside
at least i can say that ive tried ive tried
to tell you im sorry for breaking your heart
but it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore"
Easy On Me,"there aint no gold in this river
that ive been washin my hands in forever
i know there is hope in these waters
but i cant bring myself to swim
when i am drowning in this silence
baby let me in

go easy on me baby
i was still a child
didnt get the chance to
feel the world around me
i had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me

there aint no room for things to change
when we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
you cant deny how hard ive tried
i changed who i was to put you both first
but now i give up

go easy on mе baby
i was still a child
didnt get the chance to
feel thе world around me
had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me


i had good intentions
and the highest hopes
but i know right now
it probably doesnt even show

go easy on me baby
i was still a child
i didnt get the chance to
feel the world around me
i had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me"
Someone Like You,"i heard that youre settled down
that you found a girl and youre married now
i heard that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things i didnt give to you
old friend why are you so shy
aint like you to hold back or hide from the light


i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but i couldnt stay away i couldnt fight it
i had hoped youd see my face
and that youd be reminded that for me it isnt over

never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead


you know how the time flies
only yesterday was the time of our lives
we were born and raised in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days


i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but i couldnt stay away i couldnt fight it
i had hoped youd see my face
and that youd be reminded that for me it isnt over


never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
nothing compares no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes theyre memories made
who would have known how bittersweet this would taste


never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead


never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
Rolling in the Deep,"theres a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark
finally i can see you crystal clear
go ahead and sell me out and ill lay your shit bare
see how ill leave with every piece of you
dont underestimate the things that i will do
theres a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark


the scars of your love remind me of us
they keep me thinkin that we almost had it all
the scars of your love they leave me breathless
i cant help feeling

we couldve had it all youre gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand youre gonna wish you never had met me
and you played it to the beat tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep


baby i have no story to be told
but ive heard one on you now im gonna make your head burn
think of me in the depths of your despair
make a home down there as mine sure wont be shared


youre gonna wish you never had met me the scars of your love remind me of us
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep they keep me thinkin that we almost had it all
youre gonna wish you never had met me the scars of your love they leave me breathless
tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep i cant help feeling


we couldve had it all youre gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand youre gonna wish you never had met me
and you played it to the beat tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
couldve had it all
rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
but you played it with a beating
throw your soul through every open door ooh woah oh
count your blessings to find what you look for woah
turn my sorrow into treasured gold ooh woah oh
youll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow


youre gonna wish you never had met me
we couldve had it all tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
we couldve had it all yeah youre gonna wish you never had met me
it all it all it all tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep


we couldve had it all youre gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand youre gonna wish you never had met me
and you played it to the beat tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
couldve had it all youre gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand youre gonna wish you never had met me
but you played it you played it you played it
you played it to the beat"
When We Were Young,"everybody loves the things you do
from the way you talk to the way you move
everybody here is watching you
cause you feel like home youre like a dream come true
but if by chance youre here alone
can i have a moment before i go
cause ive been by myself all night long
hoping youre someone i used to know


you look like a movie
you sound like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young

let me photograph you in this light
in case it is the last time that we might
be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song


i was so scared to face my fears
nobody told me that youd be here
and i swear youd moved overseas
thats what you said when you left me


you still look like a movie
you still sound like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young


let me photograph you in this light
in case it is the last time that we might
be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young


its hard to admit that everything just takes me back
to when you were there to when you were there
and a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasnt gone
cause i still care do you still care


it was just like a movie
it was just like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young


when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young


let me photograph you in this light
in case it is the last time that we might
be exactly like we were before we realised
we were sad of getting old it made us restless
oh im so mad im getting old it makes me reckless
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song
when we were young"
