0,Drown,what doesnt kill you makes you wish you were dead got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper and i cant take one more moment of this silence the loneliness is haunting me and the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up  it comes in waves i close my eyes hold my breath and let it bury me im not okay and its not alright wont you drag the lake and bring me home again who will fix me now dive in when im down save me from myself dont let me drown who will make me fight drag me out alive save me from myself dont let me drown  what doesnt destroy you leaves you broken instead got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper and i cant take one more moment of this silence the loneliness is haunting me and the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up  it comes in waves i close my eyes hold my breath and let it bury me im not okay and its not alright wont you drag the lake and bring me home again  who will fix me now dive in when im down save me from myself dont let me drown who will make me fight drag me out alive save me from myself dont let me drown  cause you know that i cant do this on my own cause you know that i cant do this on my own cause you know that i cant do this on my own cause you know that i cant do this on my who will fix me now who will fix me now who will fix me now dive in when im down save me from myself dont let me drown
